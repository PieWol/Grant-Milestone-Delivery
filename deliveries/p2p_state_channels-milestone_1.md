| 1.     | Channel Opening           | https://github.com/peer3to/state-channels-plus/blob/db81f2bb11a032a2e4678b98ceed9f7944477325/examples/TicTacToe/contracts/TicTacToe/TicTacToeStateChannelManagerProxy.sol#L23 | This is an example of a channel opening used for the demo. The SDK doesn't impose restrictions here, so it allows for overrides and custom openings, but they must adhere to the [StateChannelManagerInterface](https://github.com/peer3to/state-channels-plus/blob/master/contracts/V1/StateChannelManagerInterface.sol) |
